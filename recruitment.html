									<h3 class="ya">Why join?</h3>
									<p class="ya">There are so many fraternities in the world. Social ones, professional ones, musical ones. You name it, there is one for anyone and everyone. The great thing about so many different Fraternal organizations is that they all have the common purpose of providing a means of growing more in your collegiate experience. Yet each Fraternity has their own way of operating and doing business differently than other groups. So what makes Sigma Lambda Beta different from the rest of the crop?! What is it that brings people to love, appreciate, and enjoy being a member of Sigma Lambda Beta? Look below and see if anything sticks to you.</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="ya">Leadership Development</li>
                                        <li class="ya">Academic Success</li>
                                        <li class="ya">Travel</li>
                                        <li class="ya">Networking</li>
                                        <li class="ya">Brotherhood</li>
                                    </ul>

									<p class="ya">Leadership Development: Being part of an entity gives you the opportunity to voice your opinion when it comes to the operations and delegation of the fraternity. As a member, you have the ability to be an influential leader on your college campus by representing the organization and showing your fellow peers what a BETA man is all about! Many of our members have taken on roles such as Presidents, Treasurers, Secretary which have later helped them to develop in both their collegiate and professional careers. Our mission places emphasis on getting involved, having a positive impact on campus, and the upward mobility both as a student and as a man. While being part of an entity of SLB is important, we also encourage our brothers to join other organizations to help strengthen that sense of leadership and dedication so that they are able to provide the same type of skills to future potential members of our fraternity.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="ya">The Pride of a Student Organization on Campus: Another benefit of being part of an entity within SLB is the resources and support you receive as a student organization on campus. Many of our chapters work very closely with the Office of Fraternity and Sorority life, Student Activities, and Student/Campus Involvement. These outlets partner with our fraternity to maintain a quality student organization that will enhance student life and promote diversity in many different ways!</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="ya">Providing Innovative Programs/Events for the Student Body: As a Brother of Sigma Lambda Beta, it is important that we are continuously promoting our mission and principles. One way that we do this is through our programming and development. As the student culture changes and adapts, we want to ensure as members of a Greek organization that we offering programs, events, and activities that are geared to the growth and awareness of the student body and the surrounding community. Many of our entities have developed programs around the health and safety of college students, academic success and retention, events celebrating the Latino culture, community service wide programming, forums and rallies discussing issues and current events, as well as activities and socials that help to promote Sigma Lambda Beta in a positive light.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="ya">“Being your Brother’s Keeper”: While being a Brother of Sigma Lambda Beta does hold a significant responsibility both as a student and a member, it is also a way to challenge the minds and the thought process of other brothers within our organization(s). Having the accountability of others, as well as being an impact to the entity is an important process in the growth and development of a fraternity.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="ya">Networking/Lasting Connections between Brothers: One of the major benefits of being part of an entity of Sigma Lambda Beta is the networking opportunities you encounter both on campus and off campus. When you are representing an organization, you have the chance to meet a variety of people from all different parts of the world. Being a Fraternity man places you in a unique position which opens up many opportunities that might not been available before. In addition to meeting new people, being a member of an entity connects you to numerous chapters and alumni members both in your surrounding areas and regions. What’s remarkable about being a part of SLB is the instant connection you make with a Brother, even though you are meeting them for the first time. It is the bond of Brotherhood, mentorship and support that helps strengthen the networking opportunities as a BETA man!</p>
